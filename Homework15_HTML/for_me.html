	<h1 align="right"> Short biography </h1>
	<p class="p1" align="justify"> I'm Martin and I'm 26. I have graduated Second English Language school in Sofia
	and the University of National and World Economy afterwards. My bacalaureate degree is 
	European studies and the master degree - Financial management. My interest to technology 
	dates back in the years while being a child. I have damaged several computers and that used to be the way 
	I learned how they work. I remeber I used to write HTML on dreamweaver. It was some wonderful experience. <br/>
	About my current job - me and my family own a private kindergarten and I am responsible for everything
	except the educational part with children. All types of organisational, administrative and economical 
	work. The kindergarten was founded over 15 years ago and I hope that soon we will accomplish another
	target - opening a primary school.

	<h1> Hobbies </h1>
	<p class="p1">
	 I have deep	interest in politics, anticommunism, and social causes. I, myself, have led several.
	Photography is another hobby to which I dedicate lots of time. I am also a big fan of snowboarding, bodybuilding,
	and all kinds of adrenaline like bungee jumping, parachute jumping e.t.c. Travelling and visiting 
	countries I've never been before, makes me feel extremely happy and deeply enriched. The same does going 
	to the theatre which is another one of my hobbies. I love visiting Levski Sofia football games, 
	especially the away ones all across the country. 
	
	<h1 align="right"> Why <sub><img src="images/ittalents.png" width="120" height="55"/></sub> ?</h1>
	<p class="p1">
	As I said already, I like technology, I like solving problems. Probably that's because the right side of
	my brain, the logical one, works better. This combined with the priceles experience we receive in the 
	training camp I think will definately result in a huge step towards upgrading my skills. A friend of mine
	told me for this great initiative and I am very glad to be a part of this project for making Bulgaria 
	a better place for living for all of us.
